<h3>Who Moved My Cheese</h3>
<p>Who Moved My Cheese? is a parable about change that takes place in a Maze where four characters look for “Cheese”—cheese being a metaphor for what we want in life.The
 four imaginary characters depicted in the story—the mice: “Sniff” and “Scurry,” and the Littlepeople: “Hem” and “Haw”—are intended to represent the simple and the complex parts of ourselves.
 I like this book as it cheers me and motivates me.It is a very short book and gives a new prospective of life.
